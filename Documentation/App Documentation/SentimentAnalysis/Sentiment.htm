search is not case-sensitive and uses wildcards. If you leave the text field blank, a search with all Tweets in the database will be made. With a click on "Analyse", the Sentiment Analysis is started </p>

<p> After a short period of time, the output will be shown right under the text field. On the left side a pie-chart is shown which illustrates the
distribution of positive, negative and neutral tweets. On the right side, numerical information about the search is shown.
